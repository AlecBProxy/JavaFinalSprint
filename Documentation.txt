*Please carefully read instructions before operating the gym management system*

Introduction
============================================================================================================

Welcome to the gym management system! Here with this program, you can run this program to complete various tasks 
including adding new users, logging in as a user, purchasing a gym membership, and more involving handling
the gym management system.

Requirements
============================================================================================================

1. Ensure you have an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) on your local computer device. Could be VS Code 
    or IntelliJ for example. 

2. Download all files from the repository or clone the repository in your IDE. 

3. Ensure you have the Java JDK installed to assist in compiling. If you do not, here is a link:

For this project I setup the initial Trello board and team meetings. I also worked on setting up the database 
connection and testing that to ensure it’s working. Next I worked on the CLI, creating the sub-menus and making sure they were styled consistently and ready to work with the other members classes. Finally I fixed a few errors and added some scripts.

Regarding challenges, the initial one was trying to learn the concepts needed for this project that weren’t discussed during class. But I would say the main challenge in the project was trying to understand the requirements versus what a full gym application would likely have as options and functions.

For this project, I created the Workout Classes feature and built the Trainer Menu, which includes options like creating, updating, and deleting workout classes. I also worked closely with my teammate on the Membership Classes and the Member Menu, helping with both functionality and testing to make sure everything worked smoothly.

I was also responsible for setting up the Trainer Menu interface, making sure it was clear and easy to use. Throughout the project, we used Trello to stay organized, and I actively collaborated with the team to plan and divide tasks.

I was responsible for creating the Membership, Membership DAO, and Membership Services files. Tested the database functionality 
in pgAdmin and tested the menu functionality. Revised the membership associated files with a teammate. Ran through the menu systems for our video and generated Javadocs for our project. 

The biggest challenge was understanding Maven and getting a handle on content not explicitly covered in class. 
Sometimes we would realize things needed to be simplified, so we would have to review project requirements and focus on the main
project objectives and attempt to succeed in completing them.
